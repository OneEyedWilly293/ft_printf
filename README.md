# ft_printf
This project is a custom implementation of the standard C library function printf(). I've built my own version called ft_printf() that mimics the behavior of the original function while following the constraints and requirements of the Hive Helsinki curriculum.

## Project Overview
The ft_printf project challenged me to recreate one of C's most versatile functions. My implementation handles various format specifiers while adhering to the Norminette coding standards required by Hive Helsinki.

This project deepened my understanding of variadic functions, string manipulation, and memory management in C. The resulting function is both efficient and readable, offering functionality similar to the original printf().

## What I've Learned
This project significantly improved my programming skills in several areas:

1) Variadic Functions: I learned how to work with functions that accept a variable number of arguments.

2) String Manipulation: The project reinforced my understanding of string processing in C.

3) Type Conversion: I gained experience with converting between different data types and their representations.

4) Code Organization: I learned to structure a complex project with multiple components that work together seamlessly.

5) Debugging Techniques: Troubleshooting the various edge cases in printf helped me develop stronger debugging skills.
